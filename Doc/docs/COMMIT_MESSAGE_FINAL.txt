feat: Add ZIP packaging for cross-platform releases

BREAKING: None (infrastructure improvement only)

This commit enhances the GitHub Actions release workflow to package
binaries in ZIP archives for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux),
making downloads and distribution more professional and user-friendly.

## Changes

### GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)

**Build Job Enhancements:**
- Added matrix configuration with platform-specific details
- Switched from nightly to stable Rust toolchain
- Create dedicated release directories for each platform
- Copy binary, README, and LICENSE to release directory
- Generate ZIP archives for all platforms:
  - Windows: grok-cli-windows-x86_64.zip
  - macOS: grok-cli-macos-x86_64.zip
  - Linux: grok-cli-linux-x86_64.zip

**Release Job Enhancements:**
- Improved artifact collection and organization
- Auto-generate release notes with download instructions
- Upload ZIP files as release assets
- Add release summary to GitHub Actions output
- Enhanced error handling and verification

### Documentation

**Created:**
- docs/RELEASE_FORMAT.md: Complete release format documentation
  - Platform-specific installation instructions
  - Archive contents specification
  - Download locations and verification
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Future plans

**Benefits:**

1. **Better User Experience:**
   - Single ZIP file per platform (easy download)
   - Includes README and LICENSE in package
   - Clear naming convention (grok-cli-{platform}-x86_64.zip)

2. **Professional Distribution:**
   - Consistent packaging across platforms
   - Platform-specific build targets
   - Automated release notes generation

3. **Easy Installation:**
   - Extract and run (no installation required)
   - Optional system-wide installation documented
   - Platform-specific instructions provided

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Automated workflow (tag → build → release)
   - Clear matrix configuration
   - Better artifact management

## Release Assets

Each release now includes three ZIP files:
- grok-cli-windows-x86_64.zip (Windows binary + docs)
- grok-cli-macos-x86_64.zip (macOS binary + docs)
- grok-cli-linux-x86_64.zip (Linux binary + docs)

## Testing

✅ Workflow syntax validated
✅ Matrix configuration tested
✅ ZIP creation logic verified
✅ Release notes template created
✅ Documentation complete

## Usage

**Create release:**
```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Release -Tag "v0.1.4" -Push
```

**Result:**
1. Builds binaries for all platforms
2. Creates ZIP archives
3. Generates release notes
4. Publishes GitHub Release with assets

## Files Changed

Modified:
- .github/workflows/release.yml: Enhanced with ZIP packaging
