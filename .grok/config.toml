# Grok CLI Project Configuration

# ─── Request / Network Timeouts ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# Total time (seconds) the HTTP client will wait for the Grok API to respond.
# LLM responses on complex prompts with tool loops can take several minutes.
# On Starlink the satellite round-trip alone adds ~600 ms and a multi-step
# session can easily run 60-120 s.
# ⚠️  NOTE: grok_api ≤ 0.1.2 has a bug where the error message ALWAYS prints
#     "Request timeout after 30 seconds" regardless of this value. The "30" in
#     that message is a hardcoded constant in the crate — your real timeout is
#     whatever you set here.  Don't change this to 30 because of that message!

# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: the grok_api crate (≤ 0.1.2) HARDCODES its own connect_timeout
#     of 10 s and does NOT expose a setter for it.  Changing this value in our
#     config currently has NO effect on actual API calls — it is reserved for a
#     future version of grok_api that exposes connect_timeout configuration.
#     Your change from 30 → 40 will not help; the real fix is timeout_secs above.
