## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-10

### Bug Fixes

- **ACP protocol `text` → `content` rename** (`src/acp/protocol.rs`)
  `ToolCallContent::Text` was serialised with `"type": "text"`, but
  `agent-client-protocol-schema` ≥ 0.12 renamed that variant to `"content"`.
  Zed was logging `"skipped malformed list entry … unknown variant text"` and
  silently dropping every tool-call content block sent to the editor.
  Fixed by changing `#[serde(rename = "text")]` → `#[serde(rename = "content")]`.

- **Slash commands blocked / `PromptResponse` delayed** (`src/acp/mod.rs`, `src/cli/commands/acp.rs`)
  `handle_chat_completion` held the `sessions` write lock for its **entire duration**,
  including all async API calls (which can take 10–300 s).  Any slash command that
  needed even a read lock (`/context`) or a write lock (`/clear`, `/model`, `/think`)
  was blocked for that entire duration.  Additionally, `save_session_to_disk` was
  called *before* `responder.respond(EndTurn)` in all three paths of
  `handle_session_prompt_v2`; if the read lock inside `save_session_to_disk` was
  contested, Zed never received the `PromptResponse` and the turn appeared to hang.

  Two fixes applied:
  1. **Lock-window reduction** — the write lock is now held only for the brief setup
     phase (user-message push, trimming, compression).  The session state is cloned
     out before the lock is released, the API call loop runs with no lock held, and a
     brief write lock is re-acquired only for per-iteration and final state syncs.
  2. **`PromptResponse`-before-save ordering** — `responder.respond(EndTurn)` is now
     called *before* `save_session_to_disk` in all three response paths so Zed always
     closes the turn immediately, regardless of lock contention on the disk save.
  *(Source: human report / AI analysis & fix)*

- **Context-window overflow in multi-turn tool loops** (`src/acp/acp.rs`)
  The token-budget trimming (steps 1-4) ran only **once**, before the tool
  loop, but each loop iteration appends an assistant message plus one or more
  tool-result messages.  After many iterations of large file reads the context
  could balloon to 12 M tokens, triggering a 400 from the API.
  Fixed by re-running `truncate_tool_results`, the count guard, and
  `trim_to_token_budget` at the **top of every loop iteration** before the API
  call.  A `WARN` log is emitted whenever mid-loop trimming fires.

### Highlights

- **ACP connection-layer rewrite** (Task 111.3) — Replaced manual JSON-RPC dispatch with `Agent.builder() + ByteStreams`. Full typed handlers for `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, etc.
- **Session persistence & fork** (Tasks 111.5, 111.7) — Disk-based session save/restore + `session/fork` support with fresh Bayesian engine.
- **ACP schema migration** (Task 111.1–111.2) — 11 types replaced with `agent-client-protocol` crate re-exports; wire-format verified.
- Multiple bug fixes for Zed compatibility (slash commands, thinking mode, file URI handling).

**655/655** lib tests + integration tests pass. Clippy clean.
